## Academic Performance Analysis: Interplay of Socioeconomic and Lifestyle Factors


### Abstract
Student academic achievement results from a complex interaction of contextual, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors. However, most research has been limited to predicting student outcomes using test scores and previous grades. Through the creation of informative statistical models, this research seeks to assess achievement in secondary school pupils in Portugal from multiple perspectives. It is possible to measure the ways in which various elements shape success when large-scale data on demographics, education, activities, attitudes, and technology use are integrated. The findings provide important behavioral and contextual information on learners, enabling parents, educators, politicians, and schools to make targeted reforms. Predictive indicators better show trends connecting student outcomes to whole academic experiences than historical scores alone. This analytical method creates fair solutions that are suited to fostering teenage education by delving deeper into the real-world interactions that shape it.
